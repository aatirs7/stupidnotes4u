# Repo Guidelines

This repository hosts a simple static website. When updating the site:

- Use 2-space indentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Ensure files end with a newline.
- After making changes, run `npx prettier --check .` to verify formatting.
- There are no automated tests beyond the prettier check.
